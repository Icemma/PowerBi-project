### Data Processing 
#### Data Importation and Cleaning 
Importation Process: Data was ingested using Power BIâ€™s Excel connector. 

#### Cleaning Steps: 
- Promoted headers for consistent column naming. 
- Converted ID columns from whole numbers to text (as they serve as unique identifiers rather than numerical values). 
- Added calculated fields for total product cost, total product price, and profit in the sales dataset. 
- Corrected data types to ensure consistency. 
- Trimmed redundant store names in the Stores Table for clarity. 
- Created a Dates Table using CALENDARAUTO() to facilitate temporal analysis, extracting year, quarter, month, and day attributes.


### Data Modeling 
Effective data modeling structures raw data into an analytical framework, allowing seamless 
relationship-building between tables. In this project, Power BI automatically identified table 
relationships, forming a star schema model: 
1. Fact Table: Sales Table, Inventory
2. Dimension Tables: Products, Stores, and Dates
